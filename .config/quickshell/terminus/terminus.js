// TERMINUS' pure half — what a directory is, and the commands that change one.
// No QML in here; TerminusWindow draws it and runs these.

// ── reading a directory ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
// find, not ls. `ls -A1p` gives names and a trailing slash and nothing else,
// so a size or a date costs a stat per row; find hands over every field in one
// pass, and -printf says exactly which ones rather than leaving them to be
// picked out of a column layout meant for a human.
//
// The separators are \037 UNIT SEPARATOR between fields and \036 RECORD
// SEPARATOR between rows, not tab and newline. A filename may legally contain
// a newline — and a tab, and a quote — so the obvious choice silently splits
// one file into two rows and mis-sizes both. These two bytes are the ones
// ASCII set aside for this job and no tool puts them in a name.
//
//   %y  type as it sits on disk      — 'l' says this entry IS a symlink
//   %Y  type after following it      — 'd'/'f', or 'N' for a broken link
//   %m  permission bits, octal       — the executable bit, for the exec glyph
//   %s  size in bytes
//   %T@ mtime as a unix float
//   %f  the name alone, without the path
// Written as escapes, not as the literal bytes: they are invisible in an
// editor, they do not survive a copy through a terminal, and a reader has no
// way to tell a lone \037 from a stray space.

// a symlinked directory in terminus produced an empty listing with no error to
// say why. `find some-symlink/` follows it, and a trailing slash on a real
// directory changes nothing at all — the printed paths are identical either
// way, single-slashed.

// and both are capped: a search that returns forty thousand rows has not
// answered anything, and building that list costs more than running it.
// Recursive, and FUZZY — artemis' two-step, in one pipe.
//
// fd on its own matches its argument as a regex against the filename, so
// "jnwn" finds nothing and "Terminus Window" finds nothing either. Artemis solved
// that by listing everything with fd and then ranking with `fzf --filter`,
// which is what makes typing four letters of a path work. Same here, minus
// artemis' index file: artemis re-searches one fixed root often enough to cache
// it, and terminus searches whatever directory you happen to be in.
//
// Directories first, exactly as artemis orders them, so they win ties. fd marks
// them with a trailing slash, which parseListing now strips.
// MATCHED AGAINST THE NAME, not against the whole path.
//
// fzf was handed complete paths, so the letters you typed could be satisfied
// by directory names three levels up — `spt` matched
// `/home/buck/Projects/spoot/src/main.rs` through the middle of "Projects" and
// scored it above a file actually called `spt`. That is what made the results
// read as random: every one of them was a genuine fuzzy hit, on a string you
// were not searching.

// segment, which is the thing being named. The whole line is still printed.

  // a file you can open, and it is nearly always the one being looked for.
  //
  // `--nth -2` for the directories and `-1` for the files, because fd ends a

// Sorted, because rg's is a PARALLEL walk and the order it finishes in is not

// different arrangements. There is no relevance to preserve here the way there
// is for a name search: every one of these files contains what you asked for,
// so the useful order is the one you can predict.
// TWO THINGS MADE THIS TAKE A MINUTE AND A HALF, and they compounded.
//
// `--no-ignore` AND `--hidden` together switch off every filter ripgrep has:
// no .gitignore, no .ignore, no skipping of dot-directories. Pointed at a home
// directory that is what it says — walk .cache, .cargo/registry, the Steam
// library, all of it. Measured searching $HOME for "function": either flag on
// its own finishes in under a tenth of a second, and the two together took
// 79.2 seconds. Yazi passes neither; `rg --color=never --files-with-matches
// --smart-case` is its whole content search, which is why it answers instantly
// on the same tree.
//
// And `sort` sat between rg and the cap. `head -c` closes the pipe when it has
// enough, which is what lets rg stop early — but sort cannot emit its first
// byte until its input has ENDED, so the cap could never reach rg and the walk
// always ran to completion. The bound has to come before the sort to be a
// bound at all.
//
// HIDDEN FILES YES, .local NO — and that pairing is the whole answer.
//
// Plain --hidden costs 79 seconds searching $HOME, and the cap does not save
// you: a common word fills 2000 matches early and head closes the pipe, so rg
// dies young, but a RARE one — a name, which is what you search for most —
// never fills it, and rg walks every byte before it can say it found four
// things. "function" answered instantly and "kbuck" took 72 seconds from the
// same command on the same tree, which is what made this so hard to see.
//
// But the cost is not spread across the hidden directories. It is ONE of them.
// Measured for "kbuck" from ~:
//
//   no --hidden                  0.0s      24 hits
//   --hidden                    79.4s     846 hits
//   --hidden, minus .local       0.7s     840 hits
//
// .local is 819GB of Steam library on this machine and contributed SIX of the
// 846. Everything people actually grep for in a hidden directory — .config,
// .cache, dotfiles at the top of home — is in the other 840, and it arrives in
// under a second. So the exclusion is one entry rather than a policy.
//
// It is also scoped rather than absolute: the glob is relative to the search
// ROOT, so standing in ~/.local and searching still searches it. It only means
// "do not descend into .local on your way somewhere else".
//
// The rest: ripgrep's own ignore rules are respected, and the result count is
// capped where the cap can still be felt upstream. --smart-case is yazi's too
// — a lower-case query matches either case, one with a capital means it.
//
// Sorted AFTER that, because rg's is a parallel walk and the order it finishes
// in is not an order — the same query twice ran the same files past you in two
// different arrangements. Every one of these files contains what you asked
// for, so the useful order is the one you can predict. Past the cap it is the

// is, and what is dirty inside it. They arrive in one process rather than two
// because the second is worthless without the first — porcelain paths are
// relative to the repository root, always, no matter which subdirectory git
// was invoked from, so the root is what turns them back into real paths.
//
// The two halves are separated by a NUL. That is not decoration: with -z the
// records themselves are NUL-terminated because a filename may legally contain
// a NEWLINE, and git stops quoting them under -z. So newline cannot separate
// anything here, and NUL can — the header is two lines of git's own output,
// which cannot contain one.
//
// --no-optional-locks matters more than it looks. Plain `git status` writes
// the index back when it refreshes stat information, so a file manager polling
// it would take the index lock every few seconds and lose races with whatever
// the user is running in a terminal. This flag makes it read-only.
//

// a whole kernel-sized repository to draw thirty rows is the difference
// between a listing that appears and one that arrives.
