// USAGE BAR — a measurement drawn as a length, with its own figure written
// inside it.
//
// One bar, two places: the size column in the disk-usage view, and the disks
// down the sidebar. They were drawn separately — a 15px band with the figure
// inside it in one, a 2px hairline with the figure sitting somewhere else in
// the other — which is two answers in one window to the same question.
//
// The number sits ON the bar. A bar and a caption beside it are two things to
// read; one band with its own value written in it is one. The TRACK is what
// makes a short bar mean anything: every row shows the full length as well as
// its own share, so "small" is read against "small compared to what" rather
// than floating in the dark.
//
// A FILE of its own rather than an inline component, because both callers are
// themselves inline components of TerminusWindow — and because the size column
// and the sidebar are as far apart as two parts of that document get.
