      // for a monitor that can show 8MB of it — and there are two Walls per
      // surface and one surface per monitor, so four full-size decodes sit
      // resident at once. That, not the module count, is where this shell's
      // memory went: a measured 92MB for one 5785x3857 wallpaper against
      // 36MB for the same file decoded to fit.
      //
      // ONE AXIS AT A TIME, WHICH IS THE WHOLE SUBTLETY. AnimatedImage is not
      // Image here: give Image both axes and it scales to COVER the box with
      // the aspect ratio intact, but give AnimatedImage both and it scales to
      // exactly that box and stretches the picture — visibly, a 3:2 wallpaper
      // squashed onto 16:9. Constrain a single axis and it preserves the
      // aspect ratio the way Image does. So pin whichever axis makes the
      // decode COVER the screen, and leave the other at 0, which is how Qt
      // spells "unconstrained":
      //
      //   image no wider than the screen -> pin the width, height overflows
      //   image wider than the screen    -> pin the height, width overflows
      //
      // The image measures its own aspect ratio for free: with one axis
      // pinned, implicitWidth/implicitHeight IS the source's ratio, so no
      // probe decode is needed to choose between the two.
      //
      // ASKED OF THE FILE, NOT OF THE DECODE, which is the whole trick.
      //
      // The obvious source for "is this wider than the screen" is the image
      // itself: with one axis pinned, implicitWidth/implicitHeight is the
      // source's ratio. But that answer exists BECAUSE of the decode that
      // sourceSize asked for, so using it to choose sourceSize is a cycle —
      // sourceSize -> decode -> status -> wide -> sourceSize. Latching it in a
      // status handler instead of a binding hid the shape of that without
      // breaking it, and Qt still said so: "Binding loop detected for property
      // sourceSize", four of them on every start.
      //
      // The probe below already knows. `magick identify` reads the header and
      // reports the file's real dimensions — the same ratio, owing nothing to
      // how the file is being decoded. So the question is asked there, and
      // this goes back to being an ordinary binding over two ordinary numbers.
      //
      // Both are 0 until the probe answers, so this is false and the
      // width-pinned branch runs — the right guess for anything that is not a
      // panorama, which is what makes the second decode the rare case.
