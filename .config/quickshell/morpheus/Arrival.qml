// long it takes. The pill's slide and the wallpaper's zoom are meant to read
// as one movement, so the shape and the schedule live in one place rather
// than being agreed on by two files that each guess.

// Split out of Zenon because this is not a design token. Zenon says what
// things look like; this says when the session has arrived.

  // with a zero duration puts the value there on the frame it is asked for.

  // ── the schedule ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  // A DEADLINE, NOT A DELAY. This is the single thing the previous version
  // got wrong and it is worth stating plainly.
  //
  // The old introDelay() returned a flat 1500ms whenever the process was
  // young, and both callers used it as a timer interval — so the wait was
  // added ON TOP of however long arming took. Arming happens on the first
  // presented frame, measured at +944ms on a real login, so the arrival
  // actually began at +2.44s and finished at +3.19s. The constant was meant
  // to say "be on screen by 1.5s"; it was being read as "wait 1.5s more".
  // That gap is the black screen.
  //
  // Read as a deadline, the wait absorbs the arm time instead of stacking on
  // it, so the arrival lands at the same moment whether arming took 600ms or
  // 1000ms. The old code drifted between +2135ms and +2518ms for that reason.
  //
  // THE NUMBER IS MEASURED, and the first attempt at it was too small. From a
  // real login (arrival-trace):
  //
  //     armed=+1018ms  cadence=+1147ms  played=+1515ms  frames=31
  //
  // Played at +1515ms the slide ran 1515->2265ms and was NOT seen: this panel
  // is not lit until around +2s, so only the last third arrived, and under
  // OutQuint the last third is nearly stationary — "already there" again. The
  // stacked version that did work played at +2135ms.
  //
  // So the visible threshold is somewhere above 1515 and at or below 2135, and
  // this sits just past it. Deterministic, unlike the 2135-2518 it replaces.
