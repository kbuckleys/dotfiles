// PATHS — where this user's things live, read from the environment once.
//
// home() had five identical definitions across the layers' .js files and
// cacheDir() three. All eight were byte-for-byte the same, which is the
// harmless end of duplication — but it is still eight places to edit the day
// one of them should have honoured XDG_HOME, and eight places for the next
// reader to check before believing any of them.
//
// A SINGLETON for the same reason Strings is one: a layer's .js cannot import
// a shared library without losing the QML document's scope, and losing that
// scope is losing `Quickshell.env` — which is the only thing these functions
// do. A singleton the host document imports stays in reach.
