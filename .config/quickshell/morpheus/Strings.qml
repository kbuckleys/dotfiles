// STRINGS — the two string functions every layer needed a copy of.
//
// shellQuote had ten identical definitions and escapeHtml nine, one per
// layer's own .js. Nineteen copies of six lines, and two of them had already
// drifted: picasso and howler had grown a `?? ""` the others never got, so the
// same call was null-safe in two layers and threw in the rest. That is what
// duplicated logic does, and it is the whole argument for this file.
//
// A SINGLETON rather than a shared .js, which is not a style choice. A .js
// file gains its own scope the moment it carries an `.import` statement, and
// loses the QML document's — so a layer's .js that imported a helpers library
// would stop being able to reach `Quickshell.env`, which several of them call.
// A plain .js keeps the host document's scope, and a singleton the document
// imports is in it: verified before this file was written.
//
// The null-safe forms are the ones kept. They are supersets — the same result
// for every input the others accepted, and an answer instead of a throw for
// null and undefined.
