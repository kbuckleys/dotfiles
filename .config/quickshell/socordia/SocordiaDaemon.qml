//
// The one structural change from that file: its actions were shell strings,
// and here they are QML. Locking used to mean spawning `qs ipc call Cerberus
// lock` — a subprocess, to talk to the process that spawned it. cerberus is
// a sibling object in this same shell now, so socordia just calls it.
