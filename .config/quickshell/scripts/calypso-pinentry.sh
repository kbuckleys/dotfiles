# CALYPSO PINENTRY — an Assuan server that answers GETPIN from calypso's own
# password field instead of drawing a window.
#
# rbw never sees the passphrase: the client sends an Unlock message over the
# agent socket and rbw-agent spawns whatever `pinentry` names in
# ~/.config/rbw/config.json, then speaks Assuan to it. So the only supported
# way to feed a password in from elsewhere is to BE that program. Calypso points
# the setting here itself (see ensureRbwConfig) so this needs no manual setup.
#
# WHEN CALYPSO IS NOT DRIVING, THIS IS THE SYSTEM PINENTRY. The fifo's existence
# is the whole signal, and the handover happens before a single Assuan line is
# read, so `rbw` from a terminal is completely unaffected — nothing has been
# consumed that the real pinentry would have needed.

FIFO="${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR:-/run/user/$(id -u)}/calypso-pinentry"
# Marks the one password calypso sent as already spent. It has to be a FILE, not
# a shell variable: rbw-agent spawns a BRAND NEW pinentry process for its
# re-prompt, so an in-process flag resets and the fresh process sat on the read
# timeout waiting for a password nobody would write.
